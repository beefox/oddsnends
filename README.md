Odds N' Ends
This is not your parents team of super-heroes, that is for sure. This comical gathering of misfits will make you riot for the sake of something... and you won't even remember what it was by the time it's over! And the best part is that it won't matter. Oddly enough, If they were to tear the world apart and rebuild it in their image, it would be uncannily simular... perhaps a few more Weird Al juke-box vinals to enjoy during Friday Game Night. They are often know and spoken as "Team Odds N' Ends" or "The Odd-Ones." They are a group of super anti-heroes, determined to do all the wrong things for all the right reasons. Predictable bad-guys are no match for the chaos that ensues, when confronting this group of mis-aligned, malconent super dweebs and mental breakdowns become a regular occurance.
